# saltools
A front-end for code I (and my friends!) write in the pursuit of developing optical payloads in support of space astrophysics. 

The organization of this code has yet to be formalized but is loosely broken down into
- sequential raytrace code tools (e.g. OpticStudio, CODE V)
- nonsequential raytrace code tools (e.g. FRED, LightTools)
- physical optics modeling tools (e.g. [POPPY](https://github.com/spacetelescope/poppy))
- analytic functions (e.g. Zernikes, Atmosphere, Disk Harmonics)
- possibly more!
